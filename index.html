            <h2>What has Vauxhall done?</h2>
            
            <p>Vauxhall is the latest car manufacturer to be caught up in the Dieselgate scandal after the German Federal Motor
            Transport Authority (KBA) found software designed to cheat emissions tests in certain Vauxhall diesel models. The
            regulator has ordered the carmaker to recall many of its models.</p>

            <p>
                The KBA has found that cheating software, commonly referred to as a defeat device, was installed into diesel engines to
                limit emissions readings during vehicle emissions testing thereby misrepresenting the actual emissions during real-world
                driving. The nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions of the engines as a result didn’t comply with EU regulatory requirements.
            </p>

            <p>NOx is a harmful combination of nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide, both of which are pollutants associated with,
            amongst other things acid rain, global warming and respiratory conditions, such as childhood asthma.
